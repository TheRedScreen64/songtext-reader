**Songtext Reader is an app to manage all your lyrics.**

## How it works
Songtext Reader displays all folders, text files and images in a selected directory. <br/>
The idea is that you have all your lyric files in one directory and can view, manage and edit them in the app. <br/>
Songtext Reader is like an explorer for lyric files, but with other useful features for lyric management. <br/>

## Features
 - Manage all your lyric files
 - View your lyric files
 - Edit your lyric files
 - Quickly search for a specific lyric file
 - Sort your lyric files
 - Customize which file extensions are shown
 
## Upcoming features
 - **In-app editor** (Until now you can only view/edit lyrics in your favorite editor (e.g. Notepad, Notepad++, VS Code, ...))
 - **Fully customizable file extension filter options** (Until now you can only show/hide .txt, .pdf, .png files)
 
**Please <a href="https://github.com/TheRedScreen64/songtext-reader/issues/new" target="_blank">open a new issue</a> with the label `feature` if you have a feature request**
